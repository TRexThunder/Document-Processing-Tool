Course Project (COL106): Utilized advanced data structures to create a dictionary to store the count of each word and a robust search engine to return all matching answers to an input query in a vast corpus.
The project was competitive and performed in groups of two, with runtime performance serving as the basis of competiton, urging us to consider various implementations like AVL trees, hashmaps, tries, etc. for the dictionary part (we chose tries) and various pattern searching algorithms like Rabin Karp, KMP, Boyer Moore, etc. for the pattern search part (we chose Rabin Karp algorithm).
